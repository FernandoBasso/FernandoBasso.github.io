This short post is just a means of collecting a few links to a small toy project of mine which features a math poem by MillÃ´r Fernandes displayed in Star Wars intro style ðŸ’«.

It is written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The interesting part is related to the CSS which is the core of the animation. Here's the <a href="https://gitlab.com/fernandobasso/math-poem-star-wars" target="_blank">Gitlab repository</a> so you can take a look at the code if you so desire.

For a live demo, <a href="{{ site.base_url }}/projects/math-poem-star-wars/poem.html" target="_blank">click here</a> or the image below.

And here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiL1uJ63CoM" target="_blank">demo video</a> I recorded from my desktop ;

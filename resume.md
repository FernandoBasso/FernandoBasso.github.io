Let me talk a bit about some of the skills helped and still help me on a day to day basis.

## Spoken languages

  - English (oral, listening and written)

  - Brazilian Portuguese is my native language

## Programming Languages

These are the programming languages that I am most comfortable with (so far ☺):

  - ECMAScript (and TypeScript)

  - PHP

  - Ruby

And these are the ones I have some knowledge about, have done some toy projects or otherwise studied a good deal about them):

  - Elm (currently studying, awesome lang\!)

  - C

  - Racket

  - Common Lisp

  - Java

  - Haskell

Some front-end technologies I have worked with for a long time:

  - Vue.js

  - HTML and CSS \[1\]

  - Sass

  - jQuery

  - Bootstrap

  - Bulma

  - Responsive layouts (with or without ready-made frameworks)

## Frameworks (back-end)

I have reasonable experience with:

  - Ruby on Rails

  - Laravel

  - Symfony

## Source Code Management

  - GIT

  - Github

  - Bitbucket

  - Gitlab

## Databases

  - General SQL.

  - MySQL / MariaDB.

  - Postgresql.

And I do know how to use them from the command line as well. I mean, if there is a GUI tool, great\! If there is not, I know my way around anyway.

## Shell Script and Command Line in General

  - Shell Script \[2\]

  - Tools like sed, grep, find, cut, and almost all other useful command line programs that one may want and need to use on a \*nix system

## Other Experience and Tools

  - Deploy and maintain Rails apps on Heroku

  - Use third-party APIs like Cloudinary and Postmark in Rails

  - TDD

  - i18n, mostly in Rails and Jekyll

## Some projects

  - A bunch of small to medium web systems to solve particular business requirements for different clients, for instance:

      - a CMS manage web sites, and a module to manage real state

      - a system to manage products (prices, stock, etc.)

      - a system to manage clients and documents

      - sites with shopping carts, user registration, etc.

  - A bunch of web sites

  - HTML/JavaScript audio player that runs in the browser

  - PHP router that I used in some of my side-projects

  - Even a Vim ftp plugin that helped me in a past job :)

<!-- end list -->

1.  Yeah, I know many do no consider this real programming, but it is part of the game nontheless.

2.  I do create scripts to help me with a lot of things like automating tasks, backups, etc.

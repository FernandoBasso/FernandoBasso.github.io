Let me talk a bit about some of the skills helped and still help me on a day to day basis.

## Programming Languages

These are the programming languages that I am most comfortable with (so far ☺):

  - ECMAScript
  - TypeScript
  - PHP
  - Ruby
  - C
  - Shell Script

And these are the ones I have some knowledge about, have done some toy projects or otherwise studied a good deal about them:

  - Racket
  - Scheme
  - Common Lisp
  - Haskell
  - Java

Some front-end technologies I have worked with for a long time:

  - Vue.js
  - React
  - HTML and CSS<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>
  - Sass
  - PostCSS
  - jQuery
  - Bootstrap
  - Bulma
  - Responsive layouts (with or without ready-made frameworks)

## Frameworks (back-end)

I have reasonable experience with:

  - Ruby on Rails
  - Laravel
  - Symfony
  - Node.js
  - Express

## Source Code Management

  - Git
  - Github
  - Bitbucket
  - Gitlab

## Databases

  - General SQL.
  - MySQL / MariaDB.
  - Postgresql.

And I do know how to use them from the command line as well. I mean, if there is a GUI tool, great\! If there is not, I know my way around anyway.

## Shell Script and Command Line in General

  - Shell Script<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>
  - Tools like sed, grep, find, cut, and almost all other useful command line programs that one may want and need to use on a \*nix system

## Documentation

Those who have worked with me know that I am crazy about self-documenting code _and_ code documentation in the form of comments. I love to have a well written and concise code doc in functions and methods explainng what it does, the parameters accepted, default parameters, what it returns, what is assumed, etc. I also like to [write about documentation]({% post_url programming/2021-03-06-documenting-source-code %}) :).

## Other Experience and Tools

- Deploy and maintain Rails apps on Heroku
- Use third-party APIs like Cloudinary and Postmark in Rails
- TDD
- i18n, mostly in Rails and Jekyll

## Some projects

- A bunch of small to medium web systems to solve particular business requirements for different clients, for instance:
- a CMS manage web sites, and a module to manage real state
- a system to manage products (prices, stock, etc.)
- a system to manage clients and documents
- sites with shopping carts, user registration, etc.

- A bunch of web sites
- HTML/JavaScript audio player that runs in the browser
- PHP router that I used in some of my side-projects
- A Vim ftp plugin that helped me in a past job :)

 <p><a name="fn1">1</a> Yeah, I know many do no consider this real programming, but it is part of the game nonetheless.</p>

 <p><a name="fn2">2</a> I do create scripts to help me with a lot of things like automating tasks, backups, etc.</p>
